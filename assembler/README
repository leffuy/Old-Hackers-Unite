Dependencies:
	boost::program_options - comes with any boost installation afaik

The general plan I had for the design of this:
	1. Read file in as one chunk
	2. Parse resulting data
		1. Use a stringstream to tokenize for us and convert integers for us
		2. When stringstream gives us back a string
			1. Match that string to a token from our language
			2. Do whatever that token requires of us, checking for syntactic correctness
			3. Convert all this to the right binary for the processor
		3. Place into the memory image array
	3. Write memory image array

What's done:
	Reading CLI arguments
	Reading the file
